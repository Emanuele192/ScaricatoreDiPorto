# Scaricatore Di Porto â€“ The Ganzest

This project is a Python application that downloads and transcribes YouTube (but not only) videos (or audio), with features for encoding, trimming, and auto-playing the downloaded file. It also supports offline transcription in multiple languages using VOSK.

## Features

- **YouTube Download:** Download videos at a selected resolution or download only the audio.
- **Encoding and Trimming:** Options to convert the downloaded file and trim unwanted sections.
- **Auto Play:** Automatically play the file after processing.
- **Offline Transcription:** Transcribe the entire video (or audio) in English or Italian using VOSK.
- **Modern GUI:** Built with CustomTkinter for a modern, user-friendly interface.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- **FFMPEG**
- **Required Python packages:**  
  - yt-dlp
  - customtkinter
  - WMI
  - vosk

## Installation and Setup
- *NOTE: the program has been tested with python 3.11.9*
- **Clone the Repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Emanuele192/ScaricatoreDiPorto.git
  cd ScaricatoreDiPorto
- **(Optional) Create a Virtual Environment:**
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  ```
  Activate the environment: 
    ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
- ** Install Dependencies:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To run the application, simply execute:
  ```bash
  python ScaricatoreDiPorto.py
  ```
**If you have downloaded the release the only thing to do is to run the executable**

**The program automatically searches for a version of ffmpeg in the system path, if it is not present you must select a build (up to the bin folder) manually from the "settings" section**

## Transcription
The application supports transcription in English and Italian.
- In the Advanced tab, enable the Transcribe toggle and choose the desired language from the dropdown menu.
- If the selected VOSK model is not present, the program will download and extract it automatically. Once downloaded, the model will be stored in a folder (named according to the model) in the project directory.
- The transcription is saved in a text file with the same base name as the downloaded video (e.g., video.mp4 becomes video.txt).

## Notes
- **Virtual Environment**: It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with globally installed packages.
- **Offline Transcription**: The transcription process extracts the audio (converted to WAV, 16 kHz, mono) and processes the entire file to ensure even long videos are fully transcribed.
- **Resource Considerations**: The VOSK models can be large. The program downloads the model on the first run and reuses it afterward.
- **The program automatically searches for a version of ffmpeg in the system path, if it is not present you must select a build (up to the bin folder) manually from the "settings" section**
