    cd ScaricatoreDiPorto
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

## Configuration

Before the first use, you need to configure a few things:

1.  **FFmpeg:** The app automatically looks for FFmpeg in your system's PATH. If not found, you must manually select the path to your FFmpeg `bin` folder in the **Settings** tab.
2.  **VOSK Models:** VOSK models are downloaded automatically on first use. The transcription process will pause until the required language model is downloaded and extracted into the application's root folder.
3.  **Gemini API Key:** To use the Gemini engine, you must provide your own Google AI API key.
    -   Get a key from **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)**.
    -   Paste the key into the **Settings** tab and click **Save Settings**.

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command from the project directory:
```bash
python ScaricatoreDiPorto.py

If you have downloaded a release, simply run the executable file.

## A Note on Antivirus

Antivirus software may flag the executable as a potential threat. This is a common false positive for applications built with PyInstaller, as the program is not signed. The application is safe to use, and the full source code is available here for review.
